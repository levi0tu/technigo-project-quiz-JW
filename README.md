# Quiz

- The assignment is to build a quiz of at least 3 questions using radio buttons, select dropdown and a submit button.
- I decided to use Super Mario Bros as theme and asked AI to create a quiz based on the criteria of the assignment.
I then started building a base structure with new files to be used in APP.jsx.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.


## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
